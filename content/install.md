The goal is to get all of the ffverse family of packages onto CRAN - both [ffscrapr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ffscrapr) and [ffsimulator](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ffsimulator) are available at this time! 

**Stable** versions of the ffverse packages can also be installed from the [ffverse R-Universe](https://ffverse.r-universe.dev) package repository - for more instructions, see the [install page](https://github.com/ffverse/universe).

**Development** versions of the ffverse packages can be installed from the [DynastyProcess R-Universe](https://dynastyprocess.r-universe.dev) package repository - install instructions [here](https://github.com/dynastyprocess/universe).
